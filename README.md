# ZeroWatee
ZeroWastee is a real-time food donation and tracking platform aimed at reducing food waste and hunger in cities like Dhaka. It connects donors with nearby verified NGOs and volunteers using a simple, GPS-enabled mobile and web app. The goal is to ensure that surplus food is collected and delivered before it goes to waste.

Built using the Incremental Development Model, ZeroWastee was developed in phasesâ€”starting with core donation features and expanding to real-time tracking, expiry-aware matching, chat support, user verification, and gamification. Key features include live pickup/delivery tracking, smart volunteer matching based on location and expiry, and a badge system to encourage participation.

The platform targets households, restaurants, NGOs, and volunteers, offering a secure and transparent way to donate or distribute food. ZeroWastee promotes sustainability, trust, and social impact through modern technology and user-friendly design.
