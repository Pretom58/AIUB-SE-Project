### _"Feeding Hungry People, Saving Wasted Food"_
ZeroWastee is a real-time food donation and tracking platform designed to reduce food waste and combat hunger in urban areas like Dhaka. Every day, large amounts of edible food are discarded by households, restaurants, and event organizers, while many people in the same city struggle with food insecurity. The root problem lies in the lack of a reliable, fast, and organized system to connect food donors with NGOs and volunteers who can safely distribute that food before it spoils. ZeroWastee solves this by offering a smart, location-aware platform that brings all stakeholders together through a user-friendly mobile and web application.

Built using the Incremental Development Model, the project was developed in structured phasesâ€”starting with core functionalities like food posting and donor-volunteer matching, followed by real-time GPS tracking, volunteer scheduling, secure in-app communication, user verification, and gamified engagement. Each increment delivered usable features that allowed early testing and feedback, making the app scalable, flexible, and practical even during development.

Key features of ZeroWastee include expiry-aware food matching, real-time pickup and delivery tracking, verified NGO and volunteer profiles, a built-in chat system, a feedback and rating mechanism, and a gamification layer that rewards users with badges and points for participation. It also promotes food safety and awareness through in-app educational content. The platform is designed for individuals, restaurants, hotels, NGOs, and volunteers who want to donate or redistribute food easily and safely.

ZeroWastee not only addresses technical and logistical challenges but also focuses on societal impact by promoting sustainable food sharing practices. By leveraging modern technology in a simple and accessible way, it creates a transparent, trustworthy, and impactful ecosystem for food redistribution. This project showcases how software solutions can meaningfully address real-world problems with limited resources.
